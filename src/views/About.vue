                    I graduated with a  Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig, where I discovered my passion for coding and web development. I'm eager to expand my knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build user-friendly websites and applications. My goal is to establish a successful career as a web developer while continuously improving my skills. I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and collaborating with others to foster growth within the tech community. In the future, I hope to mentor and inspire the next generation of developers.
